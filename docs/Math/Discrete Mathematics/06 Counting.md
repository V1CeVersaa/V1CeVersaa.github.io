# Part 6 Counting

## 6.1 The Basics of Counting

**The Product Rule**: A procedure can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks. There are $n_1$ ways to do the first task and $n_2$ ways to do the second task. Then there are $n_1*n_2$ ways to do the procedure.

**The Product Rule in Terms of Sets**: If $A_1$, $A_2$, $\cdots$, $A_m$ are all finite sets, then the number of elements in the Cartesian product $A_1 \times A_2 \times \cdots \times A_m$ is $|A_1| * |A_2| * \cdots * |A_m|$.

**The Sum Rule**: If a task can be done either in one of $n_1$ ways or in one of $n_2$ ways to do the second task, where none of the set of $n_1$ ways is the same as any of the set of $n_2$ ways, then there are $n_1 + n_2$ ways to do the task.

**The Sum Rule in Terms of Sets**: If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint sets, then $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B|$.
