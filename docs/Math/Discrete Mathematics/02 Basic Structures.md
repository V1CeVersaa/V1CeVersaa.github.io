## 2.1 Sets

A **set** is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called **elements** or members of the set. A set is said to contain its elements. We write $a\in A$ to denote that $a$ is an element of the set $A$. The notation $a\notin A$ denotes that $a$ is not an element of the set $A$.

**Roster method**: A set can be described by listing its elements between braces. For example, the set of vowels in the English alphabet can be written as $V=\{a,e,i,o,u\}$. Listing an element more than once does not change the set. The set $\{a,e,i,o,u\}$ is the same as the set $\{a,e,i,o,u,u\}$.

**Set-builder notation**: A set can be described by specifying a property that its members must satisfy.

**Universal Set**: The set $U$ containing all the objects currently under consideration.

**Empty Set**: The set containing no elements, denoted by $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$.
