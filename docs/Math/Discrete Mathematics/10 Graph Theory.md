# Part 10 Graph Theory

## 10.1 Graphs and Graph Models

**Graph**: A graph $G = (V, E)$ consists of a nonempty set of **Vertices/Nodes** $V$ and a set of **Edges** $E$. Each edge has either one or two vertices associated with it, called its **Endpoints**. An edge is said to **connect** its endpoints. If the edges connect only one vertex, it is called a **Loop**.

**Simple Gpaph**: A graph in which each edge connects two different vertices and no two edges connect the same pair of vertices.

**Multigraph**: A graph that may have multiple edges connecting the same vertices.

**Pseudograph**: A graph that may have loops, and possibly multiple edges connecting the same pair of vertices.

**Directed Graph/Digraph**: A graph $(V,E)$ consists of a nonempty set of vertices $V$ and a set of **Directed Edges/Arcs**
