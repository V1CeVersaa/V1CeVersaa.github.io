!!! info "What is tmux?"
    tmuxâ€™s authors describe it as a terminal multiplexer. Behind this fancy term hides a simple concept: Within one terminal window you can open multiple windows and split-views (called "panes" in tmux lingo). Each pane will contain its own, independently running shell instance (bash, zsh, whatever you're using). This allows you to have multiple terminal commands and applications running side by side without the need to open multiple terminal emulator windows.
