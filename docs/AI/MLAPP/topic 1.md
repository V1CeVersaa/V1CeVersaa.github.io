# Introduction

## What is Machine Learning?

**Definition**: A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$ if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.

We will treat all unknown quantities as random variables, that are endowed with probability distributions. There are two main reasons we adopt this viewpoint:

- It is the optimal approach to decision making under uncertainty.
- Probabilisitic modeling is the language used by most other areas of science and engineer, and this provides a unifying framework between these fields.
